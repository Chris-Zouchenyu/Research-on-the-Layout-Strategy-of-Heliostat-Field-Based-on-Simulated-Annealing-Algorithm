# Research-on-the-Layout-Strategy-of-Heliostat-Field-Based-on-Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm
The heliostat is one of the main components of a tower power station, responsible for receiving solar energy and reflecting it to the collector. Its layout strategy has a significant impact on the annual average output thermal power per unit mirror area of the tower power station. This article derives the solution process based on the influencing factors of output thermal power, and uses simulated annealing algorithm to solve the single objective optimization model to study the optimization of the layout of the heliostat field.
